TEMPered is a library for working with the temperature sensors we're using. You'll need to install HIDAPI before TEMPered.

BUILDING HIDAPI

git clone https://github.com/signal11/hidapi.git
cd hidapi
apt-get install -y libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev libfox-1.6-dev autotools-dev autoconf automake libtool
./bootstrap
./configure --prefix=/usr #use /usr prefix if building .deb package
make
make install

To build .deb package:

cd ..
mv hidapi hidapi-0.8.0-rc1
cd hidapi*
dh_make --createorig # select library when prompted

Now, edit the debian/control file to fix the "hidapiBROKEN" string and to add the 3 above lib dependencies: libudev-dev, libusb-1.0-0-dev, libfox-1.6-dev
remove "usr/share/pkgconfig/*" line from "debian/hidapi-dev.install" file

# Next, do
mv debian/hidapi1.dirs debian/hidapi.dirs 
mv debian/hidapi1.install debian/hidapi.install 

# finally, do:
dpkg-buildpackage


BUILDING TEMPered

git clone https://github.com/edorfaus/TEMPered.git
mv TEMPered/ tempered-1.0
cp SmartAmericaSensors/temperature/temperature-streams.c tempered-1.0/examples/
cp SmartAmericaSensors/temperature/examples_CMakeLists.txt tempered-1.0/examples/CMakeLists.txt
cd tempered-1.0
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX:PATH=/usr .
make

MAKING DEB FILE

dh_make --createorig # select library when prompted
mv debian/tempered1.install debian/tempered.install
mv debian/tempered1.dirs debian/tempered.dirs

Now, edit the debian/control file to fix the "temperedBROKEN" string and to add the hidapi-dev lib dependency
remove "usr/lib/lib*.a", "usr/lib/pkgconfig/*", "usr/share/pkgconfig/*" lines from "debian/tempered-dev.install" file, change "usr/lib/lib*.so" --> "usr/lib/*/lib*.so"
add "usr/bin/*" to "debian/tempered.install"; change "usr/lib/lib*.so.*" --> "usr/lib/*/lib*.so.*"
create file "debian/postinst.ex" to run the command `chmod 4755 /usr/bin/temperature-streams`, which
  sets the root uid/gid on the temperature-streams program once it's installed (don't forget #!/bin/sh in the 1st line!)

# finally, do:
# may have to remove "install_manifest.txt" file if you have to retry the build during this process
dpkg-buildpackage


OUR ADDITIONS

The tempy.py file provides a simple Python script for wrapping the temperature-streams program so that the temperature can be read and used within Python.

Modifications: a file under TEMPered's examples directory has been modified to support the additional temperature-streams.c file
