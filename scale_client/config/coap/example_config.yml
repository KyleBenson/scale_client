# This configuration spins up a client with dummy sensors
# It exposes a CoAP server as an event_sink and as a sensor
# so you can do GET/PUT/OBSERVE etc.

# Example test scenarios:
# Run one client with the CoapEventSink configured local-only to
# store one of the dummy sensors' data.  Run a second client
# configured with the CoapSensor so it will 'observe' the first
# client's data.  Then you can run the first with its 'remote'
# option enabled and the second with a CoapEventSink as well.
# This will cause the first client to directly upload its
# SensedEvents

# Second test scenario:
# Client 1: CoapServer only
# Client 2: dummy sensors and RemoteCoapEventSink pointed at Client 1
# Client 3: CoapSensor pointed at Client 1
# With a proper configuration (you may need to do --log-level debug,
# you should see the events originating from Client 2 show up on Client 3.

# WARNING: if you enable the local coap sink, server, dummy sensors, and coap VS
# all at the same time, there seems to still be a bug where some threads will hang
# when the program exits...

EventSinks:

      ### All remote version params below here
#      class: "remote_coap_event_sink.RemoteCoapEventSink"
      ## Can specify the source port we use in the client; note that we seem to be able to have multiple clients use the
      ## same src_port, which is useful for configuring them to treat different topics differently e.g. NON vs. CON
      # src_port: 9999
      # set this parameter to false for best-effort messages (CoAP non-CONfirmable messages)
      # confirmable_messages: False
      ## Name of CoapServer for local version to store events in
#      server_name: "default"
      # Use defaults for the REMOTE event sink testing if you run the server locally
      # e.g. by running the coapthon coapservery.py in which case use the following topic:
      # topic: "/storage/%s"

Networks:
    CoapServer:

      # By specifying this option, the server will create a root resource at this URI path
      # such that other external nodes can POST/PUT resources under this path e.g. /events/temperature
      # They will be published internally so that other apps may make use of them.

    # This VS observes the given topics and internally publishes them as SensedEvents.
    # NOTE: Careful having both a RemoteCoapEventSink and CoapSensor
    # running simultaneously and pointing to the same server-resource.  We have a hack
